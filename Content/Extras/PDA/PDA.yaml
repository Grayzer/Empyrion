    Preamble: "Begin log entry. IDA would you care to fill in our audience?\n\n[ffff00][i]1. We are in the right spatial coordinates and the correct galaxy, Andromeda, but years after the primary Terran fleet arrived.\n2. Presumably because the faulty warpdrive of our escape vessel created a wormhole in space AND time\n3. We recently discovered and explored the MS TITAN. Logs found therein indicated the fleet arrived and was ambushed, was then defeated, and fled elsewhere.\n4. For all we know, they could still be alive\n5. We have encountered the Zirax Empire and heard the names 'Talon' and 'Ancients'. Insufficient information has been acquired on those entities[-][/i]\n\nAlright, log entry completed. IDA, situational analysis on what to do next?"
    Description: "[ffff00]When we entered orbit, scans briefly indicated a debris field. I am currently scanning the logs of the stations for any signal or information.\n\nOur next objective should be to construct or acquire a warp-capable vessel.\n\nI would suggest venturing to orbit as some of the scans indicate faint warp signatures which would save us time and resources.[-]\n\nAwesome Plan IDA!\n\n[ffff00]I know.[-]"

Do grab anything you run into, but mind that most of the edible items will SPOIL/Perish.\n7a. Craft higher tier items from your collected items asap! Those have an increased perish time and do not spoil that fast!\n7b. Plants will regrow - if you find a rare plant, mark it on your minimap with a waypoint! [ffff00]Check Empyriopedia > Game Mechanics Q&A > Global Game Mechanics Part II[-] for more info on how to do that!\n8. Remember, that other players can NOT see your markers, even when they are in your faction!. You need to SHARE your markers on the MAP (M) and other players need to pick them FROM the MAP screen!\n9. The PORTABLE CONSTRUCTOR can build a LIGHT ARMOR in the PORTABLE CONSTRUCTOR, but you need a ARMOR LOCKER (in a vessel or your base) to equip it! The Locker is also craftable in the Portable Constructor\n[ff4444]10. Read the JOURNALS and GUIDES in the list on the left for MORE INFO about gameplay and environment![-]"

If an NPC is spawned in a POI, the origin of the NPC is defined by the faction of the POI, EXCEPT the creator of the POI has set a different origin for the to-be-spawned NPC (what is possible in the NPC Spawn setup dialogue!)\n3. Turret targeting info, regarding NPC factions:\n- All NPC factions members ( Zrx, Pol, Tal) apply to the 'NPC Factions' checkbox, either in a POI or when wandering around!\n- Turrets will not attack Zrx, Pol and Tal if you are on NEUTRAL standing or better, even WHEN the checkbox for NPC factions is ticked!\n- LEGACY (Global 'Alien' Faction) creatures will be attacked only when PREDATOR checkbox is ticked, as Aln is not a real NPC faction (you cannot change your standing; always HOSTILE)\n- Prey and Predator are no NPC factions.

Concurrently, the UCH has managed to set up self-sustaining operation bases in secret locations which are constantly tracked by the Zirax to eliminate the 'Intruders'.[-]"
          - ActionTitle: HISTORY
            Description: "[bcd3d4]With the discovery of the alien ship in 2402 AD, the UCH developed a plan to establish contact with the mysterious race that had deserted the ship in Antartica. Operation Phoenix, which was Earth’s last ditch effort to save itself from an impending apocalypse, was spearheaded by it’s flagship, the MS Titan.\n\nThe voyage was cut short on it’s first jump when the UCH vessels made first contact with a predatory species known as the Zirax. Outgunned and caught off guard by the enemy, losses were abundant in the initial contact with this new species. Ships, crew members and materials were lost in an instant and Earth’s flagship the MS Titan was destroyed and along with nearly all of the UCH’s leading officers. The remaining ships managed to retreat from the battle and hide in deep space, out of range of the Zirax Empire. Survivors of the battle were left to fend for themselves, of which only a few found their way back to the UCH.\n\nScientists are still gathering data and examining whether the term 'Empyrion' used loosely throughout history is a physical location or a spiritual/philosophical belief. Some members of the UCH command, believe someone positioned the Alien Ship to lure us into a trap, knowing the warp drives were dysfunctional. This is still being debated and the UCH has yet to find concrete evidence on the Zirax involvement behind the attack.[-]"

This production is facilitated by the Emperor who publicly holds supreme power, but is realistically, more a figure head.[-]"
          - ActionTitle: INTEL REPORT
            Description: "[bcd3d4]The Empire seems to overstretch itself at an increasing rate, due to the extremely fast expansion rate. As a result, the Zirax government seems to fall short on capacities for building proper stations. This leaves them incapable of recruiting the correct amount of specialized troops to fill these structures. This leads to a power vacuum in newly acquired systems, leaving them under strength and without order due to a lack of governance.[-]"

          - ActionTitle: ADDITIONAL INTEL
            Description: "The rapid expansion directly affects how most of the Zirax bases are structured, which is clearly visible when entering the facilities. We have compared the Zirax structures and have determined that all types and houses within the Zirax military are merely prefabs or standard templates. They are streamlined buildings with standardized functions, which enables the troops to get familiar with the base layouts before exiting a teleporter in a combat situation.\n\nMaterials and specimens that UCH scientists have examined and brought back from those locations, have given us the impression that the facilities are “teleported” to the destinations as a whole. We have yet to see this happen and we don’t have proof yet to say this is the case, so this is just a theory.\n\nZirax troops are often not stationed in the bases, and to maintain control of distant worlds within the territory of influence, troops will be teleported into central garrisons from an undisclosed location if a base is attacked.\n\nAI drones are mainly the first line of defense and surveillance, patrolling the area and guarding important POIs. These are controlled from a central server or by remote at a Drone base.\n\nAttack vessels in the outer rim territories operate similar to the AI drones. From what we have gathered from UCH troops on the ground who have captured a few of these vessels, these attack vessels are remote or AI controlled. Reports have shown that they remain unmanned, and did not carry any Zirax on board, although the vessels are fully capable of transporting several hundred Zirax personnel. These vessels are equipped with a self-destruct feature, which is triggered when the vessel is boarded by a non-Zirax crew.\n\nThere are rumors floating around that most of the Zirax enlisted foot soldiers are clones. This theory was brought up by a UCH science team while closely examining reports and video footage of an attack at a Zirax Bio-lab. During an interrogation of a lead scientist at the facility, the Zirax claimed that any further information could not be retrieved from the system. This may just be diversion from the truth, since all the armored Zirax soldiers look identical to human eyes."
          - ActionTitle: HISTORY
            Description: "There isn’t very much information available on the origin(s) of the Zirax Empire at this time, however Intel reports that the ancient Zirax  were in touch with the 'Elder Talon', and were given a technological boost from the advanced civilization. The Talon and Zirax were joined together in a technological and cultural Union, called the 'Zirax-Talon Assembly', which persisted for hundreds of years.\n\nWe do not know why it collapsed, why they separated, or if it was a conspiracy. Files retrieved by the 2nd UCH recon unit indicated, that the abominations found on the planets they occupied, seemed to have something to do with this or at least are related to a big incident in the past. These files were encrypted, classified and could not be deciphered until today.\n\nTheir brutality and behavior towards the Talon Guardians or anyone not from a Zirax controlled faction, indicates that there is a lot more to uncover, than official reports tell us at the moment.
