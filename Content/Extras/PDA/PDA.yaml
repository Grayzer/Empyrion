    Preamble: "Begin log entry. IDA would you care to fill in our audience?\n\n[ffff00][i]1. We are in the right spatial coordinates and the correct galaxy, Andromeda, but years after the primary Terran fleet arrived.\n2. Presumably because the faulty warpdrive of our escape vessel created a wormhole in space AND time\n3. We recently discovered and explored the MS TITAN. Logs found therein indicated the fleet arrived and was ambushed, was then defeated, and fled elsewhere.\n4. For all we know, they could still be alive\n5. We have encountered the Zirax Empire and heard the names 'Talon' and 'Ancients'. Insufficient information has been acquired on those entities[-][/i]\n\nAlright, log entry completed. IDA, situational analysis on what to do next?"
    Description: "[ffff00]When we entered orbit, scans briefly indicated a debris field. I am currently scanning the logs of the stations for any signal or information.\n\nOur next objective should be to construct or acquire a warp-capable vessel.\n\nI would suggest venturing to orbit as some of the scans indicate faint warp signatures which would save us time and resources.[-]\n\nAwesome Plan IDA!\n\n[ffff00]I know.[-]"

            Description: "[bcd3d4]A decade has passed since the Terran’s arrival to the Andromeda Galaxy, which was plagued with heartache and disaster.\nThe UCH Supreme Command still leads the Terran faction, despite the personnel fatalities on their initial jump from reactor explosions as a result of the unstable hyper drives constructed on Earth, as well as the loss of intelligence and the unfortunate demise of the MS Titan.\n\nThe UCH has successfully recruited Alien inhabitants to fill up the ranks, but the constant quarrels with the Zirax Empire have reduced Expedition fleet and resources to critical levels across the territories. Concurrently, the UCH has managed to set up self-sustaining operation bases in secret locations which are constantly tracked by the Zirax to eliminate the 'Intruders'.[-]"
          - ActionTitle: HISTORY
            Description: "[bcd3d4]With the discovery of the alien ship in 2402 AD, the UCH developed a plan to establish contact with the mysterious race that had deserted the ship in Antartica. Operation Phoenix, which was Earth’s last ditch effort to save itself from an impending apocalypse, was spearheaded by it’s flagship, the MS Titan.\n\nThe voyage was cut short on it’s first jump when the UCH vessels made first contact with a predatory species known as the Zirax. Outgunned and caught off guard by the enemy, losses were abundant in the initial contact with this new species. Ships, crew members and materials were lost in an instant and Earth’s flagship the MS Titan was destroyed and along with nearly all of the UCH’s leading officers. The remaining ships managed to retreat from the battle and hide in deep space, out of range of the Zirax Empire. Survivors of the battle were left to fend for themselves, of which only a few found their way back to the UCH.\n\nScientists are still gathering data and examining whether the term 'Empyrion' used loosely throughout history is a physical location or a spiritual/philosophical belief. Some members of the UCH command, believe someone positioned the Alien Ship to lure us into a trap, knowing the warp drives were dysfunctional. This is still being debated and the UCH has yet to find concrete evidence on the Zirax involvement behind the attack.[-]"

            Description: "[bcd3d4]The Ziraxian Empire is a militarist oligarchy and the largest power in the galaxy Andromeda. It is ruled by a series of houses, each with a specific function or functions that relates to a sphere of influence. These houses each produce a representative at an, as yet, undiscovered time, and they form a council of elders. This production is facilitated by the Emperor who publicly holds supreme power, but is realistically, more a figure head.[-]"

            Description: "[bcd3d4]The Empire seems to overstretch itself at an increasing rate, due to the extremely fast expansion rate. As a result, the Zirax government seems to fall short on capacities for building proper stations. This leaves them incapable of recruiting the correct amount of specialized troops to fill these structures. This leads to a power vacuum in newly acquired systems, leaving them under strength and without order due to a lack of governance.[-]"

            Description: "The rapid expansion directly affects how most of the Zirax bases are structured, which is clearly visible when entering the facilities. We have compared the Zirax structures and have determined that all types and houses within the Zirax military are merely prefabs or standard templates. They are streamlined buildings with standardized functions, which enables the troops to get familiar with the base layouts before exiting a teleporter in a combat situation.\n\nMaterials and specimens that UCH scientists have examined and brought back from those locations, have given us the impression that the facilities are “teleported” to the destinations as a whole. We have yet to see this happen and we don’t have proof yet to say this is the case, so this is just a theory.\n\nZirax troops are often not stationed in the bases, and to maintain control of distant worlds within the territory of influence, troops will be teleported into central garrisons from an undisclosed location if a base is attacked.\n\nAI drones are mainly the first line of defense and surveillance, patrolling the area and guarding important POIs. These are controlled from a central server or by remote at a Drone base.\n\nAttack vessels in the outer rim territories operate similar to the AI drones. From what we have gathered from UCH troops on the ground who have captured a few of these vessels, these attack vessels are remote or AI controlled. Reports have shown that they remain unmanned, and did not carry any Zirax on board, although the vessels are fully capable of transporting several hundred Zirax personnel. These vessels are equipped with a self-destruct feature, which is triggered when the vessel is boarded by a non-Zirax crew.\n\nThere are rumors floating around that most of the Zirax enlisted foot soldiers are clones. This theory was brought up by a UCH science team while closely examining reports and video footage of an attack at a Zirax Bio-lab. During an interrogation of a lead scientist at the facility, the Zirax claimed that any further information could not be retrieved from the system. This may just be diversion from the truth, since all the armored Zirax soldiers look identical to human eyes."
          - ActionTitle: HISTORY
            Description: "There isn’t very much information available on the origin(s) of the Zirax Empire at this time, however Intel reports that the ancient Zirax  were in touch with the 'Elder Talon', and were given a technological boost from the advanced civilization. The Talon and Zirax were joined together in a technological and cultural Union, called the 'Zirax-Talon Assembly', which persisted for hundreds of years.\n\nWe do not know why it collapsed, why they separated, or if it was a conspiracy. Files retrieved by the 2nd UCH recon unit indicated, that the abominations found on the planets they occupied, seemed to have something to do with this or at least are related to a big incident in the past. These files were encrypted, classified and could not be deciphered until today.\n\nTheir brutality and behavior towards the Talon Guardians or anyone not from a Zirax controlled faction, indicates that there is a lot more to uncover, than official reports tell us at the moment.
