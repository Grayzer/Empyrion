actdescPlaceAStarterBlock1,"For building any vessel, you need to craft its starter block at first. Danos helped you with that a bit and rewarded you with the starter block from the previous task.\n\nThe design is open to you, but there are some basics you need to take into account.\n\n[b]Engineering notes:[/b]\n- HV and SV starter blocks are showing blue marked blocks: The blue line marks the backside, whereas the single blue block is pointing in the flight direction! Add your cockpit facing in this direction!\n- For a Hover Vessel you need to add Hover Engines in addition. You can rise and lower the flight height of your HV with C and Space between 0 and 3 meters.\n- If your HV gets heavier, you might want to add more Hover Engines as they work as the vessels suspension (compensating uneven ground). If you do not, you might hit the ground and damage your vessel!\n- Hover Engines do NOT influence the maximum hover height of 3 meter but only the driving stability!\n- CV starter blocks come equipped with a cockpit to show you the flight direction and where UP is located! Do not mess this up while building your vessel, as those directions can not be changed afterwards!\n\n[b]Important:[/b]\n- Each vessel type demands its own blocks. Although some blocks are interchangeable, this does not mean you can use normal thrusters of a CV on a SV!\n- Each device will show you its compatibility to any of the vessel types in the mouse-over info panel on the right side of your screen (Hover over the item in either the techtree, your inventory or any constructor)\n- You can not place a HV starter block in space, but you can build all vessels on any planet!\n- If you are missing a device from your constructor, have a look at the techtree if the device is already unlocked!\n- You can NOT use Wood or Concrete to build any vessel!","Um die Konstruktion eines Vehikels zu beginnen, musst du zunächst den jeweiligen Starter-Block bauen. Öffne deinen Konstruktor und wähle im Reiter BAUBLÖCKE den Starter-Block für dasjenige Vehikel aus, welches du bauen möchtest. Lege den fertigen Starter-Block in einen freien  Platz in deiner Toolbar, wähle ihn aus und legen ihn vor dir auf den Boden.\n\nDas weitere Design liegt ab hier völlig in deinen Händen. In dieser Übungseinheit besprechen wir daher nur die Grundlagen.\n\n[b]Konstruktionshinweise:[/b]\n- Die Starter-Blöcke für BG und KR verfügen über markierte Elemente: Die blaue Block-Linie markiert die Rückseite. Der blaue einzelne Block markiert die Flugrichtung. Setze dein Cockpit IMMER in Flugrichtung!\n- Für einen Bodengleiter benötigst du mehrere Schwebesysteme! Du kannst die Flughöhe mit den Tasten C  und LEERTASTE zwischen 0 und maximal 3 Meter ändern.\n- Wenn dein BG etwas schwerer ausfällt, solltest du weitere Schwebesysteme hinzufügen. Diese funktionieren als Federung und gleichen Unebenheiten im Boden während des Fluges aus. Mit zuwenig Federung kann es passieren, dass du über den Boden schrammst und dein Vehikel beschädigst!\n- Die Anzahl der Schwebesysteme beeinflusst NICHT die maximale Flughöhe von 3 Metern sondern nur die Lagestabilität!\n- Die Starter-Blöcke für GR verfügen über ein vorinstalliertes Cockpit. Dies zeigt dir gleichzeitig an, wo OBEN und wo VORNE ist. Diese Orientierung solltest du immer beibehalten, da dies nachträglich nicht mehr geändert werden kann!\n\n[b]Wichtig:[/b]\n- Jeder Vehikel-Typ benötigt eigene Blöcke. Manche Geräte und Konstruktionsblöcke können zwar für mehrere Vehikelklassen benutzt werden, aber du  kannst z.B. nicht den großen Antrieb für ein GR auf einem BG verwenden.\n- Das Info-Detail Fenster, welches sich öffnet, wenn du mit dem Mauszeiger über einen Block oder ein Gerät fährst, zeigt dir genau an, für welche Vehikel-Klassen der Gegenstand verwendbar ist.\n- Du kannst ein BG nicht im Weltraum bauen. Du kannst aber alle Vehikel auf allen Planeten bauen.\n- Wenn dir ein Gegenstand oder ein Gerät im Konstruktor fehlt, schaue im Technikbaum (F3), nach ob es auch freigeschalten ist!\n- Holz und Beton Konstruktionsblöcke können nicht für Vehikel benutzt werden."

Without a RCS, you are limited to the aforementioned orthogonal movement vectors.","Ein RCS fügt deinem Vehikel eine gewisse Menge an Drehmoment hinzu. Das bedeutet, ein RCS erlaubt dir z.B. eine Rolle oder eine andere kombinierte Richtungsbewegungen durchzuführen. Ohne RCS kannst du nur die sechs orthogonalen Richtungen für die Bewegung nutzen: auf, ab, rechts, links, forwärts, rückwärts. Mit RCS sind alle Kombinationen möglilch."

actdescAddVFuelTank,"Add one or more fuel tanks and fill them with fuel packs. You can activate or deactivate your vessel with Y while standing on it or when sitting in the cockpit!\n\n[b]Engineering notes[/b]\n- Adding more RCS to a vessel will add more torque to your vessel. Heavy vessels will need more or stronger RCS, but a huge CV will never turn on a dime.\n- Adding RCS has a limit to a point, where adding more RCS will add fewer and fewer bits of additional torque.\n- It does not matter WHERE in your ship the RCS is placed!\n- More Fuel Tanks will provide you with an expanded maximal flight time.\n- More generators will increase the power output and output reserves, but also burn your fuel faster.\n- When you notice your power output is running in 'red mode' when doing maneuvers having a lot of energy consumers active, you need to add more generators.","Ebenfalls wie bei einer Basis, benötigst du mindestens einen Kraftstofftank. Fülle ihn mit Kraftstoffzellen. Aktivieren kannst du dein Vehikel ebenfalls mit Y, egal ob du auf ihm stehst oder im Cockpit sitzt.\n\n[b]Konstruktionshinweise:[/b]\n- Mehr RCS fügen deinem Vehikel mehr Drehmoment hinzu. Schwerere Vehikel benötigen entsprechend mehr oder stärkere RCS für die gleiche Beweglichkeit. Trotzdem wird ein riesiges GR niemals auf der Stelle wenden können.\n- Die Effizienz der RCS nimmt mit steigender Anzahl ab. Ab einem gewissen Punkt wird der Beitrag zum Drehmoment pro neuem RCS fast vollständig aufgezehrt.\n- Es ist egal, WO im Vehikel der RCS steht.\n- Zusätzliche Kraftstofftanks steigern deine Reichweite und Flugzeit.\n- Zusätzliche Generatoren erhöhen die verfügbare Spitzenleistung deines Vehikels. Allerdings verbrauchen sie auch die Kraftstoffzellen schneller.\n- Wenn du bei Manövern bemerkst, dass deine Leistungsanzeige immer wieder ROT wird, benötigst du mehr Generatoren."

acttitleAddVThrusters,"Add Thrusters","Triebwerk einbauen"
actdescAddVThrusters,"For a Hover Vessel, you only need one thruster facing forward, left, right and back. For a Small Vessel or a Capital Vessel you need a thruster facing up and one facing down in addition!\n\n[b]Important:[/b]\n- Do not mix up thrusters of different kinds on either side. Always have the same amount and type of thrusters competing with each other on each opposing side: Up vs. Down, Left vs. Right and Forward vs. Reverse. If you do not apply to this rule, your vessel may show unstable movement.\n- Adding more Thrusters will not make your vessel faster, but accelerate faster!\n- If you are parking your Small Vessel or Hover Vessel on a hillside or sloped terrain, switch off your thruster group to avoid your vessel sliding away!\n\n [b]Keep up speed without pressing W:[/b] If you want to avoid holding W all the time while flying towards a destination, open the Control Panel (P) and switch off the forward facing thrusters. Now, when hitting W, your vessel won't be slowed down any more. You need to reactivate your Brake Thruster Group if you want to slow down, of course!","Für einen Bodengleiter benötigst du nur jeweils ein Triebwerk für die Richtungen vorwärts, rückwärts, rechts und links. Für ein Kleines Raumschiff und ein Großes Raumschiff benötigst du zwei zusätzliche Triebwerke für die Richtungen auf und ab.\n\n[b]Wichtig[/b]\n- Mische niemals verschiedene Triebwerkstypen an verschiedene Seiten. Baue immer gleiche Typen and gegenüberliegenden Seiten: rechts vs. links, auf vs. ab und voraus vs. zurück. Wenn du diese Regel nicht beherzigst, kann dein Vehikel instabil werden.\n- Zusätzliche Triebwerke machen dein Vehikel nicht schneller. Es beschleunigt nur schneller bis zur Maximalgeschwindigkeit.\n- Wenn du dein Kleines Raumschiff oder deinen Bodengleiter am Hang parken willst, schalte das Vehikel mit Y ab, sonst kann es passieren, dass es weg rutscht.\n\n[b]Du willst immer geradeaus fliegen, ohne W die ganze Zeit gedrückt halten zu müssen? Wenn du einfach nur geradeaus fliegen willst, schalte  alle Triebwerke der Forward-Gruppe ab und beschleunige mit W auf die Maximalgeschwindigkeit. Wenn du bremsen willst, musst du deine Gruppe mit den Bremstriebwerken natürlich wieder einschalten."

This also applies to Capital Vessel cockpits!.\n\nAdd an O2 tank to your vessel and put some O2 bottles inside. You'll then first use up those, before your suit Oxygen is used.\n\n[u]Tips:[/u]\n- Open the console (P) to check how much Oxygen is left\n- You do not need to add an O2 station to your vessel for this to work. O2 stations are only required to refill your suit's O2 manually.","Alle Cockpits sind luftdicht versiegelt! Auch wenn du in einer sauerstoffreichen Umgebung herumfliegst, wird dein Anzugsauerstoff verbraucht, solange du im Cockpit sitzt. Das gilt auch für die Cockpits für Große Raumschiffe.\n\nUm das zu vermeiden, baue einen O2 Tank ein und fülle ihn mit O2 Flaschen. Damit wird dann immer zuerst der Sauerstoff aus dem O2 Tank benutzt, bevor dein Anzugsauerstoff angezapft wird.\n\n[u]Tipps:[/u]\n- Öffne die Steuerkonsole um herauszufinden, wie viel O2 dir verbleibt.\n- Für die automatische O2 Versorgung im Cockpit brauchst du keine O2 Station im Schiff. Diese dient  nur dazu, damit du manuell deinen Anzugsauerstoff wieder auftanken kannst."

You can of course enter a turret and use it manually as well.\n- Mounted guns can be managed manually, but will reload automatically if you keep the fire button pressed!\n- If you aim at a target, your fixed guns will converge automatically!\n- Homing missiles only lock on their target if you were pointing at this target when firing!","Um deine Waffen zu versorgen, musst du eine Munitionskiste irgendwo in deinem Vehikel einbauen und sie mit der Munition füllen, die deine Geschütze benötigen. Sie laden sich dann automatisch nach.\n\n[b]Konstruktionshinweise:[/b]\n- Türme schießen automatisch und laden automatisch nach. Du kannst aber auch in einen Turm einsteigen und ihn selbst bedienen.\n- Feste Geschütze werden manuell abgefeuert und geladen, allerdings laden sie auch automatisch nach, wenn du die Feuertaste gedrückt hältst.\n- Wenn du das Fadenkreuz auf ein Ziel gerichtet hast, richten sich die festen Geschütze automatisch auf diesen Feuerpunkt ein.\n- Die zielsuchenden Raketen schalten ebenfalls nur auf, wenn du das Fadenkreuz beim Abfeuern auf ein Ziel gerichtet hattest!"
tasktitleDockingPads,"Docking Pads and Landing Gears","Andockplatte und Fahrwerk"
acttitleAddVDockingPads,"Add Docking Pads or Landing Gears","Landehilfe einbauen"
actdescAddVDockingPads,"Docking Pads as well as Landing Gears will not only allow you to dock your HV and SV to a CV, but also allow your vessel to land on uneven terrain or absorb damage of a hard landing on solid terrain. If yo do NOT use those devices, you'll easily damage and break your vessel.\n\n[b]How to use docking pads and landing gears:[/b]\n- If you built a CV and want to take your SV and HV with you, your SV and HV will need to have any type of Docking Pad or Landing Gear added underneath the vessel.\n- Docking works just by landing on a flat space on your CV. There is no docking button. Keep an eye on the right info panel. The docking status will tell you if your vessel is docked or not!\n- If you want to take off, just hit SPACE (default) and un-docking is happening automatically as well.\n- Docking is only possible for SV and HV. The CV landing gears do not 'dock' to a Base.\n- SV and HV can not be docked to each other.\n\n[b]Important:[/b]\n- Your CV and the to-be-docked vessel need to be in the same faction. If you did not change anything (like in any Single Player Game), every newly created vessel is set to PRIVATE automatically. If you play in Multiplayer and join a Faction, you can only dock a Faction-Vessel to its Faction-CV!\n- Exception: A CV that is set to PUBLIC can be used as a docking platform for vessels with any faction status!","Andockplatten und Fahrwerke erlauben es dir nicht nur, deinen Bodengleiter oder dein Kleines Raumschiff in einem Großen Raumschiff anzudocken. Sie absorbieren auch Schaden bei einer harten Landung auf festem Untergrund. Wenn du keine benutzt, kannst du dein Vehikel mit einer unsanften Landung schwer beschädigen!\n\n[b]So benutzt du Andockplatten und Fahrwerke:[/b]\n- Um ein BG oder KR in einem GR zu docken, benötig dein GB oder KR eines der beiden Geräte an der Unterseite\n- Das Docken selbst funktioniert ganz einfach: Drücke C und lande auf einer ebenen Fläche in oder auf dem Großen Raumschiff. Wirf einen Blick auf das Info-Fenster rechts am Bildschirmrand. Es zeigt dir, ob du angedockt bist oder nicht. Es gibt keine Docking-Taste!\n- Das Abheben vom Landedeck passiert auf gleiche Weise. Drücke dazu einfach die LEERTASTE.\n- Es können nur BG und KR an ein GR gedockt werden. Docken von BG an BG, BG and KR oder KR an KR ist nicht möglich.\n- Das Große Raumschiff und die anzudockenden Vehikel müssen in der gleichen Fraktion sein! Spielst du im Survival-Singleplayer, sind alle deine Schiffe immer in der gleichen Fraktion (sofern du daran nichts änderst).\n- Einzige Ausname für Multiplayer sowie Singleplayer: auf einem Großen Raumschiff, welches auf ÖFFENTLICH gestellt ist, können alle Bodengleiter und Kleinen Raumschiffe andocken, egal welcher Fraktion sie angehören!"
tasktitleAdditionalBlocks,"Additional Blocks","Zusätzliche Schiffseinrichtungen"

actdescAdditionalVBlocks,"You can of course add several other, useful blocks to your vessel.\n\n[u]Suggestions:[/u]\n- Add a cargo box to store loot and a fridge to store food.\n- If you plan to do a big round trip with a lot of expected dangerous exploration, you might need some spare parts to be produced while under way. Add a small constructor to your SV or HV or a large/advanced Constructor to your CV. This way you can fix broken devices without having to return to your base too early.\n- If you build a CV, you should add a Gravity Generator. If your ship is standing still, this will allow you to walk around in your vessel.\n- If you want to WARP to another planet, your CV needs to be equipped with a Warpdrive. Warpdrives are only available for a CV! You need to add the Warp Drive Tank and add Pentaxid Crystals as a fuel (Pentaxid is crafted from Blue Crystals, found on most of the Planets. On Maiy, dive into the deeper lakes to find them!)","Es gibt viele weitere, nützliche Zusatzgeräte, die du einbauen kannst. \n\n[u]Empfehlung:[/u]\n- Statte dein Vehikel mit  mindestens einer Frachtbox für Beute und Teile sowie einem Kühlschrank für Nahrungsmittel aus.\n- Wenn du länger unterwegs bist, benötigst du irgendwann Ersatzteile die du unterwegs herstellen musst. Baue deshalb einen Kleinen Konstruktor (BG,KR) oder einen Großen Konstruktor (GR) ein. So kannst du Schäden beheben, ohne bis zu deiner Basis zurück fliegen zu müssen.\n- Wenn du ein GR baust, plane unbedingt einen Gravitationsgenerator ein. Er erlaubt dir, dass du in deinem Schiff herumlaufen kannst, solange es sich nicht bewegt.\n- Willst du mit deinem GR zu anderen Planeten aufbrechen, benötigst du einen Warpantrieb (nur für GR verfügbar) sowie einen Warpantrieb Tank, gefüllt mit Pentaxid Kristallen (Pentaxid wird aus den Blauen Kristallen gewonnen, die du z.B. in den Seen von Maiy, im Sumpf von Neo, in den Ebenen von Maiy oder auch auf höheren Lagen auf Ningues finden kannst!)"

acttitlePlaceBAStarter,"Place Base Starter","Basis-Starter platzieren"
actdescPlaceBAStarter,"Building a base always starts with crafting and laying down a base starter block.\n\nOpen your Survival constructor and find the 'base starter' block in the Building Blocks tab. Move the base starter block to a free slot in your toolbar and place it on the terrain.\n\nAfter having successfully placed the starter block, create at least 10 more blocks of any material to increase the base plate size. Choosing the material (Wood, Concrete, Steel or Hardened Steel) is up to you. Each of the materials has its own advantages and disadvantages concerning resource need, stability, armor and hitpoints.\n\n[u]Tips:[/u]\n- You can move the Core Block up and down vertically ahead of placing it. You do NOT need to level the ground. Just use PAGE UP or PAGE DOWN to level the Core block.\n- You can add a LINE of hull blocks by holding the left-mouse button and dragging the mouse\n- You can add a PLANE of blocks by holding CTRL and dragging the mouse. Place yourself on an elevated position - this will make creating a plane much easier! \n - You can deconstruct, disassemble, upgrade and rotate a placed block with the Multitool (you need to unlock it from the Techtree and craft the tool at first). Use right-mouse click to set the working mode of the Multitool. \n[b]PLEASE NOTE:[/b]   If you destroy a device with a filled inventory, like a constructor or fridge, its contents will drop in backpacks for you to collect. \n\n[b]Important:[/b]\n- All of your buildings are affected by the [b]Structural -Integrity[/b]\n- Different materials have different structural integrity characteristics![/b].\n- Press N to open the Build-Helper Menu and tick the box for the Structural Integrity Overlay - this will show you if your build is stable (green areas).. or if it will break with the next block placed (orange and red areas).","Das Bauen einer Basis beginnt immer damit, den Basis-Starter herzustellen und an einer geeigneten Stelle zu platzieren.\n\nÖffne den Überlebenskonstruktor und wähle die Vorlage 'Basis-Starter' im Reiter  BAUBLÖCKE aus. Wenn du den Basis-Starter fertig produziert hast, lege ihn in einen freien Platz in deiner Toolbar, wählen ihn aus und setze ihn an einer geeigneten Stelle auf dem Boden ab\n\nWenn du den Basis-Starter angelegt hast, stelle mindestens noch 10 weitere Konstruktionsblöcke her um die Grundplatte deiner Basis für die benötigten Geräte zu erweitern. Ob du die Blöcke aus Holz, Beton, Stahl oder Gehärtetem Stahl herstellst, ist dir überlassen. Jedes Material hat seine eigenen Vor- und Nachteile in Bezug auf Ressourcenkosten, Stabilität, Panzerung und Haltbarkeit.\n\n[u]Tipps[/u]\n- Du kannst den Kern Block vertikal nach oben und unten bewegen bevor du ihn setzt. Du musst den Boden NICHT vorher glätten! Nutze einfach BILD HOCH und BILD RUNTER zum die Platzierhöhe zu verändern.\n- Du kannst eine ganze REIHE an Konstruktionsblöcken platzieren, indem du die linke Maustaste gedrückt hältst und die Maus ziehst.\n- Du kannst eine FLÄCHE von Konstruktionsblöcken platzieren, indem du STRG gedrückt hältst und die Maus ziehst. Beim Erstellen einer Fläche, stelle dich vorher immer auf eine erhöhte Position! Das macht die Sache einfacher.\n- Mit dem Multifunktionstool kannst du Blöcke wieder abbauen, aufnehmen, rotieren oder upgraden (Das Gerät musst du im Techinkbaum freischalten und im Konstruktor herstellen). Klicke die rechte Maustaste um den Arbeitsmodus des Gerätes einzustellen.\n- Wenn du ein Gerät mit gefülltem Geräte-Inventar abbaust, erscheinen dessen Inhalte als Rucksäcke die du aufsammeln kannst.\n\n[b]Wichtig:[/b]\n- Alle Basen auf Planeten sind von der 'Strukturellen Integrität' betroffen.\n- Verschiedene Materialien haben verschiedene Charakteristiken bezogen auf die Strukturelle Integrität.\n- Drücke N um das Bauhilfen-Menü aufzurufen und schalte dort den den Modus zur Anzeige der Strukturellen Integrität an. Dieser  zeigt dir, ob deine Bauten stabil (grüne Bereiche) oder kurz davor sind, in sich  zusammen zu fallen (orange/rote Bereiche)."

You may first need to unlock them in the TechTree (F3)!\n\n[u]Tip:[/u]\n- Don't scrap the survival constructor! You only get 1 and can't make a replacement. Better use it for ammo, refining ores or building basic blocks!\n- When you start on Maiy, an O2 Station and an O2 Tank are no pressing needs, as the atmosphere is breathable. If you started on Maiy, prioritize those devices even ahead of a turret!\n- Open the Control Panel (P) and set your base as your 'Home Base'. If you die in a remote place or on another planet or in space, this will allow you to spawn close to this Base again\n-Add the Clone Chamber to your Home Base and the Home-Base Respawn option will take you right there (without the Clone Chamber, you'll spawn somewhere at or around your base)!\n\n[b]Note:[/b]: The Large Constructor and the Food Processor are partly automated devices. You do not need to craft intermediate products such as components manually. A yellow text in the detail screen of a template indicates, that you don't have the components, but enough base materials like ore or ingots. As long as you have added enough ore or ingots to the constructor inventory, the device will create all intermediate products on its own.","Stelle jetzt einen Kühlschrank her (Stoppt die Verfallszeit), sowie die O2 Station (füllt deinen Anzug mit Sauerstoff nach). Produziere außerdem einen O2 Tank (benötigt für die O2 Station, gefüllt mit O2 Flaschen aus dem O2 Generator) und einen Nahrungsmittel-Prozessor.\n\nDir fehlen all diese Geräte in den Vorlagen? Prüfe, ob sie im Technikbaum (F3) freigeschalten sind!\n\n[u]Tipps:[/u]\n- Zerstöre niemals absichtlich den Überlebenskonstruktor. Du hast nur Einen und kannst keinen Ersatz herstellen. Nutze ihn besser auch weiterhin, z.b. für einfache Vorgänge wie das Verarbeiten von Erzen, das Herstellen von Munition oder einfachen Konstruktionsblöcken und Komponenten.\n- Wenn du auf Maiy startest, sind ein O2 Tank und eine O2 Station zu Anfang nicht wirklich wichtig. Startest du aber auf Maiy, solltest du die beiden Geräte noch vor dem Geschützturm bauen!\n- Öffne die Steuerkonsole und mache deine Basis zu deinem Startpunkt. Wenn du weit entfernt ohne eine wirkliche Rückkehrmöglichkeit stirbst, z.B. im Weltraum oder auf einem anderen Planeten, erlaubt dir diese Einstellung, in der Nähe deiner Heimatbasis wiederbelebt zu werden.\n- Mit der Klonkammer kannst du zusätzlich exakt bestimmen, wo genau in deiner Basis du wiederbelebt wirst.  Ohne die Klonkammer steigst du lediglich 'in der Nähe' deiner Heimatbasis wieder ins Spiel ein!\n\n[b]Hinweis:[/b] Der Große Konstruktor sowie der Nahrungsmittelprozessor sind teilweise automatisierte Geräte. Du brauchst hierbei die Zwischenprodukte, wie z.B. Komponenten nicht selbst herstellen. Eine gelbe Schrift in der Detailansicht einer Vorlage weist dich darauf hin, dass zu zwar die notwendigen Komponenten nicht im Konstruktor Inventar hast, allerdings genügend Grundmaterialien vorhanden sind. Solange dies gewährleistet ist, kann der Constructor die Zwischenprodukte alle selbst herstellen.\n"

If you build your overhanging structure, make sure you place the growing light on the ceiling in the centre of any 3*3 farming field.\n- Some harvested crops are edible directly after being harvested, but most of the crops will benefit from a refinement. Put the crops into the inventory of the food processor and create a meal!\n- Grown and cooked food will not give you the poisoned food disease!","Jede Pflanze hat unterschiedlich lange Wachstumszeiten.

You can only achieve 100% stability for a vertical row of blocks, if the lowest block is touching the ground. If you have a 100% stable block, a so called 'anchor block', you can build a vertical pillar on top of it as high as the sky. There is no vertical limit (yet). \n\n3. If you add blocks to such a 100% stable pillar in any horizontal direction, so each block that is attached in a row, any additional block will have a lower stability - until the row reaches a breaking point. The maximum range or breaking point for a horizontal, floating, not supported beam made out of any of the four base materials is 12 blocks. Note: The anchor block will keep its stability, as there is no such thing as shear force (yet)! [u]Tip:[/u] if your line or area of blocks is showing weak spots, just build a supporting pillar! \n\n4. Do not put heavy materials or devices on top of a already weak beam or weak foundation. You might risk the construction to collapse and your devices will be destroyed.",""

Use RIGHT-MOUSE button to set your weapons and tools to the correct WORKING MODE before using!\n4. Do not waste your STAMINA, as the Survival Tool relies on it and rebuilding stamina will cost EXTRA FOOD POINTS!\n5. Drill as many rocks as you can get hold of, preferably Ore Rocks!\n5a. Deco Rocks will not hold any ore, but different amounts of Crushed Stones.\n5b. These Crushed Stones are very useful as [ffff00]you can extract ores from it[-] in the Portable Constructor!\n5c. As soon as you found or crafted a Portable Constructor, [ffff00]craft a DRILL T1[-] as this will allow you to drill underground ore deposits! The required [ffff00]BIOFUEL[-] (Which can also power your vessels and bases!) can be made from fiber, which can be made from wood logs or fiber plant!\n5d. Avoid getting trapped in a mine shaft by using your PERSONAL DRONE (F5) for mining.\n6. Cold and Heat can be countered eigher by the [ffff00]Portable Heater/Cooler[-] (Survival Constructor) or Hot- and Cold Beverages/Juices!\n7. Do grab anything you run into, but mind that most of the edible items will SPOIL/Perish.\n7a. Craft higher tier items from your collected items asap! Those have an increased perish time and do not spoil that fast!\n7b. Plants will regrow - if you find a rare plant, mark it on your minimap with a waypoint! [ffff00]Check Empyriopedia > Game Mechanics Q&A > Global Game Mechanics Part II[-] for more info on how to do that!\n8. Remember, that other players can NOT see your markers, even when they are in your faction!. You need to SHARE your markers on the MAP (M) and other players need to pick them FROM the MAP screen!\n9. The PORTABLE CONSTRUCTOR can build a LIGHT ARMOR in the PORTABLE CONSTRUCTOR, but you need a ARMOR LOCKER (in a vessel or your base) to equip it!

UNITED_COUNCIL_OF_HUMANITY_(UCH_)_Action_HISTORY_Description,"[bcd3d4]With the discovery of the alien ship in 2402 AD, the UCH developed a plan to establish contact with the mysterious race that had deserted the ship in Antartica. Operation Phoenix, which was Earth’s last ditch effort to save itself from an impending apocalypse, was spearheaded by it’s flagship, the MS Titan.\n\nThe voyage was cut short on it’s first jump when the UCH vessels made first contact with a predatory species known as the Zirax. Outgunned and caught off guard by the enemy, losses were abundant in the initial contact with this new species. Ships, crew members and materials were lost in an instant and Earth’s flagship the MS Titan was destroyed and along with nearly all of the UCH’s leading officers. The remaining ships managed to retreat from the battle and hide in deep space, out of range of the Zirax Empire. Survivors of the battle were left to fend for themselves, of which only a few found their way back to the UCH.\n\nScientists are still gathering data and examining whether the term 'Empyrion' used loosely throughout history is a physical location or a spiritual/philosophical belief. Some members of the UCH command, believe someone positioned the Alien Ship to lure us into a trap, knowing the warp drives were dysfunctional. This is still being debated and the UCH has yet to find concrete evidence on the Zirax involvement behind the attack.[-]",""

Danos helped you with that a bit and rewarded you with the starter block from the previous task.\n\nThe design is open to you, but there are some basics you need to take into account.\n\n[b]Engineering notes:[/b]\n- HV and SV starter blocks are showing blue marked blocks: The blue line marks the backside, whereas the single blue block is pointing in the flight direction! Add your cockpit facing in this direction!\n- For a Hover Vessel you need to add Hover Engines in addition. You can rise and lower the flight height of your HV with C and Space between 0 and 3 meters.\n- If your HV gets heavier, you might want to add more Hover Engines as they work as the vessels suspension (compensating uneven ground). If you do not, you might hit the ground and damage your vessel!\n- Hover Engines do NOT influence the maximum hover height of 3 meter but only the driving stability!\n- CV starter blocks come equipped with a cockpit to show you the flight direction and where UP is located! Do not mess this up while building your vessel, as those directions can not be changed afterwards!\n\n[b]Important:[/b]\n- Each vessel type demands its own blocks. Although some blocks are interchangeable, this does not mean you can use normal thrusters of a CV on a SV!\n- Each device will show you its compatibility to any of the vessel types in the mouse-over info panel on the right side of your screen (Hover over the item in either the techtree, your inventory or any constructor)\n- You can not place a HV starter block in space, but you can build all vessels on any planet!\n- If you are missing a device from your constructor, have a look at the techtree if the device is already unlocked!\n- You can NOT use Wood or Concrete to build any vessel!",""

If you do not apply to this rule, your vessel may show unstable movement.\n- Adding more Thrusters will not make your vessel faster, but accelerate faster!\n- If you are parking your Small Vessel or Hover Vessel on a hillside or sloped terrain, switch off your thruster group to avoid your vessel sliding away!\n\n [b]Keep up speed without pressing W:[/b] If you want to avoid holding W all the time while flying towards a destination, open the Control Panel (P) and switch off the forward facing thrusters.

If yo do NOT use those devices, you'll easily damage and break your vessel.\n\n[b]How to use docking pads and landing gears:[/b]\n- If you built a CV and want to take your SV and HV with you, your SV and HV will need to have any type of Docking Pad or Landing Gear added underneath the vessel.\n- Docking works just by landing on a flat space on your CV. There is no docking button. Keep an eye on the right info panel. The docking status will tell you if your vessel is docked or not!\n- If you want to take off, just hit SPACE (default) and un-docking is happening automatically as well.\n- Docking is only possible for SV and HV. The CV landing gears do not 'dock' to a Base.\n- SV and HV can not be docked to each other.\n\n[b]Important:[/b]\n- Your CV and the to-be-docked vessel need to be in the same faction. If you did not change anything (like in any Single Player Game), every newly created vessel is set to PRIVATE automatically. If you play in Multiplayer and join a Faction, you can only dock a Faction-Vessel to its Faction-CV!\n- Exception: A CV that is set to PUBLIC can be used as a docking platform for vessels with any faction status!",""

Add a small constructor to your SV or HV or a large/advanced Constructor to your CV. This way you can fix broken devices without having to return to your base too early.\n- If you build a CV, you should add a Gravity Generator. If your ship is standing still, this will allow you to walk around in your vessel.\n- If you want to WARP to another planet, your CV needs to be equipped with a Warpdrive. Warpdrives are only available for a CV! You need to add the Warp Drive Tank and add Pentaxid Crystals as a fuel (Pentaxid is crafted from Blue Crystals, found on most of the Planets.
