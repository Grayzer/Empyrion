  - ChapterTitle: 10 Tips for GETTING STARTED  
    Category: FAQ
    Preamble: ""
    Description: "1. Play the Robinson Protocol (Singleplayer, Default Random Scenario)\n2. The [ffff00]SURVIVAL TOOL[-] has a DEFENCE mode!\n3. Use RIGHT-MOUSE button to set your weapons and tools to the correct WORKING MODE before using!\n4a. Plan AHEAD what you need to pick up and mind the VOLUME and MASS limit of your suit!\n4b. Try to buld a Portable Constructor early on to store the surplus!\n5a. Deco Rocks will not hold any ore, but different amounts of Crushed Stones, which can again be made into some Ores!\n5b. As soon as you found or crafted a Portable Constructor, [ffff00]craft a DRILL T1[-] as this will allow you to drill underground ore deposits! The required [ffff00]BIOFUEL[-] (Which can also power your vessels and bases!) can be made from fiber, which can be made from wood logs or fiber plant!\n5d. Avoid getting trapped in a mine shaft by using your PERSONAL DRONE (F5) for mining.\n6. Cold and Heat can be countered either by the [ffff00]Portable Heater/Cooler[-] (Survival Constructor) or Hot- and Cold Beverages/Juices!\n7. Do grab anything you run into, but mind that most of the edible items will SPOIL/Perish.\n7a. Craft higher tier items from your collected items asap! Those have an increased perish time and do not spoil that fast!\n7b. Plants will regrow - if you find a rare plant, mark it on your minimap with a waypoint! [ffff00]Check Empyriopedia > Game Mechanics Q&A > Global Game Mechanics Part II[-] for more info on how to do that!\n8. Remember, that other players can NOT see your markers, even when they are in your faction!. You need to SHARE your markers on the MAP (M) and other players need to pick them FROM the MAP screen!\n9. The PORTABLE CONSTRUCTOR can build a LIGHT ARMOR in the PORTABLE CONSTRUCTOR, but you need a ARMOR LOCKER (in a vessel or your base) to equip it! The Locker is also craftable in the Portable Constructor\n[ff4444]10. Read the JOURNALS and GUIDES in the list on the left for MORE INFO about gameplay and environment![-]"

            Description: "1. All the faction-assignments below apply to wandering NPCs and Patrols at all times (does NOT depend on the faction territory!)\n2. If an NPC is spawned in a POI, the origin of the NPC is defined by the faction of the POI, EXCEPT the creator of the POI has set a different origin for the to-be-spawned NPC (what is possible in the NPC Spawn setup dialogue!)\n3. Turret targeting info, regarding NPC factions:\n- All NPC factions members ( Zrx, Pol, Tal) apply to the 'NPC Factions' checkbox, either in a POI or when wandering around!\n- Turrets will not attack Zrx, Pol and Tal if you are on NEUTRAL standing or better, even WHEN the checkbox for NPC factions is ticked!\n- LEGACY (Global 'Alien' Faction) creatures will be attacked only when PREDATOR checkbox is ticked, as Aln is not a real NPC faction (you cannot change your standing; always HOSTILE)\n- Prey and Predator are no NPC factions. That's why they have their own targeting setting."

Concurrently, the UCH has managed to set up self-sustaining operation bases in secret locations which are constantly tracked by the Zirax to eliminate the 'Intruders'.[-]"

            Description: "[bcd3d4]With the discovery of the alien ship in 2402 AD, the UCH developed a plan to establish contact with the mysterious race that had deserted the ship in Antartica. Operation Phoenix, which was Earth’s last ditch effort to save itself from an impending apocalypse, was spearheaded by it’s flagship, the MS Titan.\n\nThe voyage was cut short on it’s first jump when the UCH vessels made first contact with a predatory species known as the Zirax. Outgunned and caught off guard by the enemy, losses were abundant in the initial contact with this new species. Ships, crew members and materials were lost in an instant and Earth’s flagship the MS Titan was destroyed and along with nearly all of the UCH’s leading officers. The remaining ships managed to retreat from the battle and hide in deep space, out of range of the Zirax Empire. Survivors of the battle were left to fend for themselves, of which only a few found their way back to the UCH.\n\nScientists are still gathering data and examining whether the term 'Empyrion' used loosely throughout history is a physical location or a spiritual/philosophical belief. Some members of the UCH command, believe someone positioned the Alien Ship to lure us into a trap, knowing the warp drives were dysfunctional. This is still being debated and the UCH has yet to find concrete evidence on the Zirax involvement behind the attack.[-]"

As a result, the Zirax government seems to fall short on capacities for building proper stations. This leaves them incapable of recruiting the correct amount of specialized troops to fill these structures. This leads to a power vacuum in newly acquired systems, leaving them under strength and without order due to a lack of governance.[-]"

            Description: "Negotiations seem to be impossible / Haven’t succeeded yet; Hostile for now"
          - ActionTitle: ADDITIONAL INTEL
            Description: "The rapid expansion directly affects how most of the Zirax bases are structured, which is clearly visible when entering the facilities. We have compared the Zirax structures and have determined that all types and houses within the Zirax military are merely prefabs or standard templates. They are streamlined buildings with standardized functions, which enables the troops to get familiar with the base layouts before exiting a teleporter in a combat situation.\n\nMaterials and specimens that UCH scientists have examined and brought back from those locations, have given us the impression that the facilities are “teleported” to the destinations as a whole. We have yet to see this happen and we don’t have proof yet to say this is the case, so this is just a theory.\n\nZirax troops are often not stationed in the bases, and to maintain control of distant worlds within the territory of influence, troops will be teleported into central garrisons from an undisclosed location if a base is attacked.\n\nAI drones are mainly the first line of defense and surveillance, patrolling the area and guarding important POIs. These are controlled from a central server or by remote at a Drone base.\n\nAttack vessels in the outer rim territories operate similar to the AI drones. From what we have gathered from UCH troops on the ground who have captured a few of these vessels, these attack vessels are remote or AI controlled. Reports have shown that they remain unmanned, and did not carry any Zirax on board, although the vessels are fully capable of transporting several hundred Zirax personnel. These vessels are equipped with a self-destruct feature, which is triggered when the vessel is boarded by a non-Zirax crew.\n\nThere are rumors floating around that most of the Zirax enlisted foot soldiers are clones. This theory was brought up by a UCH science team while closely examining reports and video footage of an attack at a Zirax Bio-lab. During an interrogation of a lead scientist at the facility, the Zirax claimed that any further information could not be retrieved from the system. This may just be diversion from the truth, since all the armored Zirax soldiers look identical to human eyes."
          - ActionTitle: HISTORY
            Description: "There isn’t very much information available on the origin(s) of the Zirax Empire at this time, however Intel reports that the ancient Zirax  were in touch with the 'Elder Talon', and were given a technological boost from the advanced civilization. The Talon and Zirax were joined together in a technological and cultural Union, called the 'Zirax-Talon Assembly', which persisted for hundreds of years.\n\nWe do not know why it collapsed, why they separated, or if it was a conspiracy. Files retrieved by the 2nd UCH recon unit indicated, that the abominations found on the planets they occupied, seemed to have something to do with this or at least are related to a big incident in the past. These files were encrypted, classified and could not be deciphered until today.\n\nTheir brutality and behavior towards the Talon Guardians or anyone not from a Zirax controlled faction, indicates that there is a lot more to uncover, than official reports tell us at the moment.
