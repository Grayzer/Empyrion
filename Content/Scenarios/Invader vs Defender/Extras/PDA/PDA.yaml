    Category: FAQ
    Preamble: ""
    Description: "1. Play the Robinson Protocol (Singleplayer, Default Random Scenario)\n2. Craft the free-of-cost [ffff00]SURVIVAL TOOL[-] in your build-in [ffff00]Survival Constructor[-] (TAB)\n3. Use RIGHT-MOUSE button to set your weapons and tools to the correct WORKING MODE before using!\n4. Do not waste your STAMINA, as the Survival Tool relies on it and rebuilding stamina will cost EXTRA FOOD POINTS!\n5. Drill as many rocks as you can get hold of, preferably Ore Rocks!\n5a. Deco Rocks will not hold any ore, but different amounts of Crushed Stones.\n5b. These Crushed Stones are very useful as [ffff00]you can extract ores from it[-] in the Portable Constructor!\n5c. As soon as you found or crafted a Portable Constructor, [ffff00]craft a DRILL T1[-] as this will allow you to drill underground ore deposits! The required [ffff00]BIOFUEL[-] (Which can also power your vessels and bases!) can be made from fiber, which can be made from wood logs or fiber plant!\n5d. Avoid getting trapped in a mine shaft by using your PERSONAL DRONE (F5) for mining.\n6. Cold and Heat can be countered eigher by the [ffff00]Portable Heater/Cooler[-] (Survival Constructor) or Hot- and Cold Beverages/Juices!\n7. Do grab anything you run into, but mind that most of the edible items will SPOIL/Perish.\n7a. Craft higher tier items from your collected items asap! Those have an increased perish time and do not spoil that fast!\n7b. Plants will regrow - if you find a rare plant, mark it on your minimap with a waypoint! [ffff00]Check Empyriopedia > Game Mechanics Q&A > Global Game Mechanics Part II[-] for more info on how to do that!\n8. Remember, that other players can NOT see your markers, even when they are in your faction!. You need to SHARE your markers on the MAP (M) and other players need to pick them FROM the MAP screen!\n9. The PORTABLE CONSTRUCTOR can build a LIGHT ARMOR in the PORTABLE CONSTRUCTOR, but you need a ARMOR LOCKER (in a vessel or your base) to equip it! The Locker is also craftable in the Portable Constructor\n[ff4444]10. Read the JOURNALS and GUIDES in the list on the left for MORE INFO about gameplay and environment![-]"

            Description: "[bcd3d4]A decade has passed since the Terran’s arrival to the Andromeda Galaxy, which was plagued with heartache and disaster.\nThe UCH Supreme Command still leads the Terran faction, despite the personnel fatalities on their initial jump from reactor explosions as a result of the unstable hyper drives constructed on Earth, as well as the loss of intelligence and the unfortunate demise of the MS Titan.\n\nThe UCH has successfully recruited Alien inhabitants to fill up the ranks, but the constant quarrels with the Zirax Empire have reduced Expedition fleet and resources to critical levels across the territories. Concurrently, the UCH has managed to set up self-sustaining operation bases in secret locations which are constantly tracked by the Zirax to eliminate the 'Intruders'.[-]"
          - ActionTitle: HISTORY
            Description: "[bcd3d4]With the discovery of the alien ship in 2402 AD, the UCH developed a plan to establish contact with the mysterious race that had deserted the ship in Antartica. Operation Phoenix, which was Earth’s last ditch effort to save itself from an impending apocalypse, was spearheaded by it’s flagship, the MS Titan.\n\nThe voyage was cut short on it’s first jump when the UCH vessels made first contact with a predatory species known as the Zirax. Outgunned and caught off guard by the enemy, losses were abundant in the initial contact with this new species. Ships, crew members and materials were lost in an instant and Earth’s flagship the MS Titan was destroyed and along with nearly all of the UCH’s leading officers. The remaining ships managed to retreat from the battle and hide in deep space, out of range of the Zirax Empire. Survivors of the battle were left to fend for themselves, of which only a few found their way back to the UCH.\n\nScientists are still gathering data and examining whether the term 'Empyrion' used loosely throughout history is a physical location or a spiritual/philosophical belief. Some members of the UCH command, believe someone positioned the Alien Ship to lure us into a trap, knowing the warp drives were dysfunctional. This is still being debated and the UCH has yet to find concrete evidence on the Zirax involvement behind the attack.[-]"
