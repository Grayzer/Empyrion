chaptertitle1,Chapter 1 – Finally… some action!,
preamble1,"You are a covert operations specialist for the Union of Federal Planets (UFP). A recent spy report indicates that a new weapon is being constructed in secret by the Zirax Empire - the Union's biggest threat. Your mission is to find out what the secret weapon is, to locate it and then to destroy it. You have landed with the Tactical Commando Module on Brexxis, a desolate ice planet. Your superiors assume you can pick up the trail from there.\n\nDesigner's note: Please be careful when placing explosives in usual places or going crazy with rockets. While we made sure story related sensors can't be destroyed easily by accident, it's still possible. This could result in you not being able to progress on your mission. Always save the game before you enter story relevant POIs.",
chpdesc1,"Now that you haven woken up from your cryo-sleep, you must check your base and the equipment the UFP has provided you with. The UFP hopes to find clues to the secret weapon's whereabouts by tracing down Zirax support routes. Find the Zirax Promethium refinery nearby and infiltrate it. Search for any information which can tell you more about the secret weapon.",

acttitle122,[c][ffffff]Find a console with cargo data,
actdesc122,There should be a computer console somewhere in the promethium refinery where you can access data about arriving and departing freighters. Tracking their travel patterns should tell you where the Zirax are building their secret weapon.,
complete122,\n,
complete1,"Next to the core, you have found a terminal which allows access to the backup servers of this refinery. \nAfter scanning them, you realize the files contain data about traffic and shipments arriving at and departing from this refinery. \nThe data you uploaded to your PDA indicates that an unusually high amount of Promethium is being shipped to the Veldis system.\n\n[c][8faed3]Chapter reward:[/c] 10000 credits money card",
chaptertitle2,Chapter 2 – To boldly go where others have gone before,
chpdesc2,"Promethium is the source of energy every base and starship vessel relies on to operate. The data you extracted from the refinery's database shows massive amounts of Promethium being shipped to Veldis, a nearby planet. This indicates a lot of energy is being used there for some massive project. This could be the construction of the secret weapon you are looking for. You still aren't sure what the new secret Zirax weapon could be, where it could be located and how it could be destroyed. Getting to Veldis is your best option at this point. Use your experience as a survivalist and build a capital vessel with a warp drive to travel to Veldis. The Union of Federated Planets operates spy satellites in the orbit of most known Planets. These satellites could deliver more vital information regarding their vicinity.  Locate such a satellite in the orbit of Veldis to see what it might have picked up.",

chpdesc3,"Instead of the scans made by this satellite, you find a personal message in the database for you. UFP agent Andisk probably expected that another UFP agent would eventually find his message: “Agent, if you can read this, then the UFP considered the data of this satellite vital for your mission. They may have noticed us spying on them a while ago. And they must have been waiting for the right moment to strike. Their drones found this satellite and attacked it. They mustn't have wanted us to find a specific piece of information. I extracted the vital data before they could find me or destroy this satellite.

chaptertitle4,Chapter 4 – The Access Code,
chpdesc4,"Thanks to the planet system scans you are able to investigate the data the satellite has picked up. The Zirax have started the construction of a cannon so large that a whole base has been built around it. This must be the weapon you are looking for. Recent recordings of test runs indicate that this stationary weapon is able to blast asteroids into a million pieces with a single shot. Instead of vaporizing the debris of the asteroid, every tiny bit accelerates into the orbit of the planet at a high speed, where it circulates for many months and possibly years due to the gravitational attraction. This would have major impacts on any ship traveling through such an affected system. Ship hulls could be severely damaged by just passing through. Due to the tiny size of the debris, no counter measurement would be able to stop it. It might be the worst weapon the Zirax have ever created. You must destroy the construction of this Asteroid Buster cannon before the Zirax can put it into action.\n\nFind the security code to be able to access the well-guarded parts of this new Zirax base which holds the Asteroid Buster. Agent Andisk tracked down the location of a high ranking officer who oversees the construction of this weapon. He is currently visiting a Zirax Tactical Outpost deep in Zirax territory. You will not be able to bring your own ship though. Agent Andisk has instead bribed the freighter captain of ""The Wolf Fang"" on Veldis to get you there in secret.
