            Description: >-
              [bcd3d4]With the discovery of the alien ship in 2402 AD, the UCH
              developed a plan to establish contact with the mysterious race
              that had deserted the ship in Antartica. Operation Phoenix, which
              was Earth’s last ditch effort to save itself from an impending
              apocalypse, was spearheaded by it’s flagship, the MS Titan.


              The voyage was cut short on it’s first jump when the UCH vessels
              made first contact with a predatory species known as the Zirax.
              Outgunned and caught off guard by the enemy, losses were abundant
              in the initial contact with this new species. Ships, crew members
              and materials were lost in an instant and Earth’s flagship the MS
              Titan was destroyed and along with nearly all of the UCH’s leading
              officers. The remaining ships managed to retreat from the battle
              and hide in deep space, out of range of the Zirax Empire.
              Survivors of the battle were left to fend for themselves, of which
              only a few found their way back to the UCH.


              Scientists are still gathering data and examining whether the term
              'Empyrion' used loosely throughout history is a physical location
              or a spiritual/philosophical belief. Some members of the UCH
              command, believe someone positioned the Alien Ship to lure us into
              a trap, knowing the warp drives were dysfunctional. This is still
              being debated and the UCH has yet to find concrete evidence on the
              Zirax involvement behind the attack.[-]

            Description: >-
              [bcd3d4]The Ziraxian Empire is a militarist oligarchy and the
              largest power in the galaxy Andromeda. It is ruled by a series of
              houses, each with a specific function or functions that relates to
              a sphere of influence. These houses each produce a representative
              at an, as yet, undiscovered time, and they form a council of
              elders. This production is facilitated by the Emperor who publicly
              holds supreme power, but is realistically, more a figure head.[-]
          - ActionTitle: INTEL REPORT
            Description: >-
              [bcd3d4]The Empire seems to overstretch itself at an increasing
              rate, due to the extremely fast expansion rate. As a result, the
              Zirax government seems to fall short on capacities for building
              proper stations. This leaves them incapable of recruiting the
              correct amount of specialized troops to fill these structures.
              This leads to a power vacuum in newly acquired systems, leaving
              them under strength and without order due to a lack of
              governance.[-]

              Negotiations seem to be impossible / Haven’t succeeded yet;
              Hostile for now
          - ActionTitle: ADDITIONAL INTEL
            Description: >-
              The rapid expansion directly affects how most of the Zirax bases
              are structured, which is clearly visible when entering the
              facilities. We have compared the Zirax structures and have
              determined that all types and houses within the Zirax military are
              merely prefabs or standard templates. They are streamlined
              buildings with standardized functions, which enables the troops to
              get familiar with the base layouts before exiting a teleporter in
              a combat situation.


              Materials and specimens that UCH scientists have examined and
              brought back from those locations, have given us the impression
              that the facilities are “teleported” to the destinations as a
              whole. We have yet to see this happen and we don’t have proof yet
              to say this is the case, so this is just a theory.


              Zirax troops are often not stationed in the bases, and to maintain
              control of distant worlds within the territory of influence,
              troops will be teleported into central garrisons from an
              undisclosed location if a base is attacked.


              AI drones are mainly the first line of defense and surveillance,
              patrolling the area and guarding important POIs. These are
              controlled from a central server or by remote at a Drone base.


              Attack vessels in the outer rim territories operate similar to the
              AI drones. From what we have gathered from UCH troops on the
              ground who have captured a few of these vessels, these attack
              vessels are remote or AI controlled. Reports have shown that they
              remain unmanned, and did not carry any Zirax on board, although
              the vessels are fully capable of transporting several hundred
              Zirax personnel. These vessels are equipped with a self-destruct
              feature, which is triggered when the vessel is boarded by a
              non-Zirax crew.


              There are rumors floating around that most of the Zirax enlisted
              foot soldiers are clones. This theory was brought up by a UCH
              science team while closely examining reports and video footage of
              an attack at a Zirax Bio-lab. During an interrogation of a lead
              scientist at the facility, the Zirax claimed that any further
              information could not be retrieved from the system. This may just
              be diversion from the truth, since all the armored Zirax soldiers
              look identical to human eyes.
          - ActionTitle: HISTORY
            Description: >-
              There isn’t very much information available on the origin(s) of
              the Zirax Empire at this time, however Intel reports that the
              ancient Zirax  were in touch with the 'Elder Talon', and were
              given a technological boost from the advanced civilization. The
              Talon and Zirax were joined together in a technological and
              cultural Union, called the 'Zirax-Talon Assembly', which persisted
              for hundreds of years.


              We do not know why it collapsed, why they separated, or if it was
              a conspiracy. Files retrieved by the 2nd UCH recon unit indicated,
              that the abominations found on the planets they occupied, seemed
              to have something to do with this or at least are related to a big
              incident in the past. These files were encrypted, classified and
              could not be deciphered until today.


              Their brutality and behavior towards the Talon Guardians or anyone
              not from a Zirax controlled faction, indicates that there is a lot
              more to uncover, than official reports tell us at the moment.

              [bcd3d4]The Talon, also known as Talon Guardians, are an
              astonishingly primitive society with little variation. The name,
              'Talon Guardian' stems from a largely mysterious past with the
              Zirax. The Zirax impose a heavy toll upon the Talon guardians –
              zealously sheltering them with drones and other restraints. This
              may indicate either the Talon pose a threat to them… or are kept
              hostages for some unknown reason.[-]
