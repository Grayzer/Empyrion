      1. Play the Robinson Protocol (Singleplayer, Default Random Scenario)

      2. Craft the free-of-cost [ffff00]SURVIVAL TOOL[-] in your build-in
      [ffff00]Survival Constructor[-] (TAB)

      3. Use RIGHT-MOUSE button to set your weapons and tools to the correct
      WORKING MODE before using!

      4. Do not waste your STAMINA, as the Survival Tool relies on it and
      rebuilding stamina will cost EXTRA FOOD POINTS!

      5. Drill as many rocks as you can get hold of, preferably Ore Rocks!

      5a. Deco Rocks will not hold any ore, but different amounts of Crushed
      Stones.

      5b. These Crushed Stones are very useful as [ffff00]you can extract ores
      from it[-] in the Portable Constructor!

      5c. As soon as you found or crafted a Portable Constructor, [ffff00]craft
      a DRILL T1[-] as this will allow you to drill underground ore deposits!
      The required [ffff00]BIOFUEL[-] (Which can also power your vessels and
      bases!) can be made from fiber, which can be made from wood logs or fiber
      plant!

      5d. Avoid getting trapped in a mine shaft by using your PERSONAL DRONE
      (F5) for mining.

      6. Cold and Heat can be countered eigher by the [ffff00]Portable
      Heater/Cooler[-] (Survival Constructor) or Hot- and Cold Beverages/Juices!

      7. Do grab anything you run into, but mind that most of the edible items
      will SPOIL/Perish.

      7a. Craft higher tier items from your collected items asap! Those have an
      increased perish time and do not spoil that fast!

      7b. Plants will regrow - if you find a rare plant, mark it on your minimap
      with a waypoint! [ffff00]Check Empyriopedia > Game Mechanics Q&A > Global
      Game Mechanics Part II[-] for more info on how to do that!

      8. Remember, that other players can NOT see your markers, even when they
      are in your faction!. You need to SHARE your markers on the MAP (M) and
      other players need to pick them FROM the MAP screen!

      9. The PORTABLE CONSTRUCTOR can build a LIGHT ARMOR in the PORTABLE
      CONSTRUCTOR, but you need a ARMOR LOCKER (in a vessel or your base) to
      equip it! The Locker is also craftable in the Portable Constructor

      [i]We always assume that evolution

      in the universe follows the same rules,

      so there is a high chance that we do not

      see anything extraordinary when looking to the stars.

      Of course, the chances that we are wrong, are equally high.

              at the ceiling in the center spot of this array.
               - If the outside conditions meet the Growing Conditions, you can set up a farm without a growing light on the outside. In this case OUTSIDE = open to the sky with no roof (includes NO windows)[-]

              NOTE:
               - Spiders can be alerted, but without seeing the player, in this case it will run around 'searching' the source of the alert
               - The ability to scare the spider is to make the fight more dynamic, to give the player more breathing room and something interesting. The spider should not run away completely.

              [bcd3d4]A decade has passed since the Terran’s arrival to the
              Andromeda Galaxy, which was plagued with heartache and disaster.

              The UCH Supreme Command still leads the Terran faction, despite
              the personnel fatalities on their initial jump from reactor
              explosions as a result of the unstable hyper drives constructed on
              Earth, as well as the loss of intelligence and the unfortunate
              demise of the MS Titan.


              The UCH has successfully recruited Alien inhabitants to fill up
              the ranks, but the constant quarrels with the Zirax Empire have
              reduced Expedition fleet and resources to critical levels across
              the territories. Concurrently, the UCH has managed to set up
              self-sustaining operation bases in secret locations which are
              constantly tracked by the Zirax to eliminate the 'Intruders'.[-]
          - ActionTitle: HISTORY
            Description: >-
              [bcd3d4]With the discovery of the alien ship in 2402 AD, the UCH
              developed a plan to establish contact with the mysterious race
              that had deserted the ship in Antartica. Operation Phoenix, which
              was Earth’s last ditch effort to save itself from an impending
              apocalypse, was spearheaded by it’s flagship, the MS Titan.


              The voyage was cut short on it’s first jump when the UCH vessels
              made first contact with a predatory species known as the Zirax.
              Outgunned and caught off guard by the enemy, losses were abundant
              in the initial contact with this new species. Ships, crew members
              and materials were lost in an instant and Earth’s flagship the MS
              Titan was destroyed and along with nearly all of the UCH’s leading
              officers. The remaining ships managed to retreat from the battle
              and hide in deep space, out of range of the Zirax Empire.
              Survivors of the battle were left to fend for themselves, of which
              only a few found their way back to the UCH.


              Scientists are still gathering data and examining whether the term
              'Empyrion' used loosely throughout history is a physical location
              or a spiritual/philosophical belief. Some members of the UCH
              command, believe someone positioned the Alien Ship to lure us into
              a trap, knowing the warp drives were dysfunctional. This is still
              being debated and the UCH has yet to find concrete evidence on the
              Zirax involvement behind the attack.[-]

      You look like someone that has grown to like some...privacy.


      We, as a company, are the biggest advocates of privacy - but we are
      afraid,

      the Zirax Empire does not really value this like you and we do

      Wonderful performance in your last mission!

      But we are afraid we need to invest more time in the well-being of the
      creatures of this planet - especially around ore deposits.


      Some minerals seem to affect the wildlife and we do not have a
      prospector...I mean, skilled explorers, at hand.


      Your bearing shows you are a skilled Explorer.

      So may we ask you for this favor again and [fff000]scout a few ore
      deposits[-] - only for checking the living conditions of the native
      animals, of course.

      Currently, our biggest concern are the radiated zones on this planet.


      The promethium stones and deposits in that area seem to fuel the radiated
      zones ecosystem and harm our worke...the precious lifeforms there.


      We would like to ask you to venture in such a zone,

      check what is happening there and [fff000]bring back a few samples of
      promethium[-] so we can make profit...examine it!

      It seems the Zirax do not value our combined efforts to improve our
      companies

      ..the planets..situation and have sent in an attack force to one of our
      facilities.


      On behalf of the POLARIS board of directors, we ask you to head there and
      help with the defences!

      company operations, but also store dangerous substances in 3rd party
      non-licensed containers?


      That's something we cannot accept, correct?


      Can you possibly step by a Zirax facility and check if the storage areas
      are up to our high company standards?

      A recently seized cargo transport lead us to the assumption that the

      If i would not know their obvious profit plans any better, I would have

      Ha! Now we got them with their dirty company hands deep into illegal
      transactions!


      A scout team has caught a POLARIS team selling medicals, building material
      and other commodities to the Talon.

      We are sure, they also selling them weapons, so we NEED to act now!


      Zirax High Court has ordered to clear the POLARIS Trading compound by
      weapon fire.


      Go there and proof you loyalty to the Empire. No survivors.
